<h3>Example 3</h3>
<p>Free fall</p>
<p>In this example we let objects with different masses fall from the same height inside a gravity field similar to our planets gravity field .What is your prediction?Which of the balls is going to reach the ground first?Those with the bigger masses or the ones with the smaller?</p>

<p>A Constant <span style="color:blue">acceleration</span> gives us a constant change of <span style="color:blue">Speed</span>.A gravity field gives masses inside a constant acceleration:</p>
<ul><li>The mass of the objects has nothing to do with the acceleration they inherit from the field they are in</li>
<li>If an object has constant acceleration then its speed is defined by its acceleration and the time until it reaches the ground is only relevant to those factors.</li>
